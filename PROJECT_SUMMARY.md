When discussing this project:

1. **Problem Solving**: "Children struggle to communicate their feelings to doctors, so I built an emoji-based tracking system that's intuitive for kids."

2. **UX Design**: "I used large touch targets, bright colors, and simple language because my target users are children."

3. **Technical Skills**: "Built with React for component reusability, used LocalStorage for data persistence, and Vite for optimized builds."

4. **User Research**: "The emoji-based mood tracking came from research showing children communicate better with visual cues than text."

5. **Iterative Design**: "Started with wireframes in Figma, then built a prototype, and refined based on usability testing."
